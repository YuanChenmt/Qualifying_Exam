# Qualifying_Exam
Some random codes and RANDOM write-ups for PhD qualifying exam.

I have distinct files for each experiments, stiff or non stiff respectively. 

For the QRNN codes, feel free to play around, I have many unnecessary install commands, just to make sure it actually works.

I have the device command, but I have never used GPU and I'm not sure it works, the visualization is an EXAMPLE, NOT the actual model we used. 

Unfortunatly, you need to switch the optimizer manually, but it provides more flexibility (KINDA)!

The default backend is used here, but the lightning is also installed, feel free to try.

Be preparedâ€”some of these experiments may take a while to run. This is largely due to the nature of running quantum algorithms on classical hardware. D
