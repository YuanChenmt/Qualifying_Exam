# Qualifying_Exam

This repository contains a collection of codes and write-ups developed for my PhD qualifying exam. Each experiment, whether involving stiff or non-stiff systems, is organized into its respective files.

The QRNN codes are available for exploration, with a few extra install commands included to ensure smooth operation. There's a device command included, though it hasn’t been tested on a GPU—so consider it more of an optimistic feature. The visualizations provided are examples and not the actual models used, intended to serve as a reference.

Manual switching of the optimizer is required, which may seem inconvenient but offers flexibility in experimenting with different setups. The default backend is configured, with Lightning also installed for those interested in trying it out.

Be aware that some experiments may take forever to run, it's due to quantum algorithms on classical hardware.
