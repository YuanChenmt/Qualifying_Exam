# Qualifying_Exam
Some random codes and RANDOM write-ups for PhD qualifying exam

For the QRNN codes. feel free to play around, I have many unnecessary install commands, just to make sure it actually works.

I have the device command, but I have never used GPU and I'm not sure it works, the visualization is an EXAMPLE, NOT the actual model we used. 

Unfortunatly, you need to switch the optimizer manually, but it provides more flexibility (KINDA)!
The default backend is used here, but the lightning is also installed, feel free to try.
